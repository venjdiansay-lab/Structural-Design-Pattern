# Architecture Overview â€“ Modular Media Streaming Suite

The Modular Media Streaming Suite is designed as a flexible, extensible system for handling different media sources, runtime playback strategies, and modular feature plugins. The architecture is built around principles of modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Each major function is separated into layers and packages, allowing for easy updates or extensions without affecting the entire codebase.

The system is divided into several logical packages: source, player, plugin, playlist, and proxy. The MediaSource interface provides a uniform way to retrieve media. The MediaPlayer abstraction (Bridge) delegates rendering to Renderer implementors. Decorators add optional features, Composite allows nested playlists, and Proxy adds caching for remote content. Adapter wraps legacy sources to conform to MediaSource.
